                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p class="text">The Northland Animal Welfare Society, Inc. ("NAWS") is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization that serves as a coalition for Clay and Platte counties dedicated to educating citizens regarding the humane treatment of animals. NAWS works to create awareness, regarding the need to reduce the number of homeless animals and to build a care and adoption campus so that every animal may live in a safe and caring environment.</p>

                <h2>NAWS Facts</h2>
                <p class="text">The Northland Animal Welfare Society opened the NAWS Low Cost Spay/Neuter Clinic on February 25, 2012, making it the first ever spay and neuter clinic in the Northland. We believe that by offering education and low cost spay/neuter services to the higher risk, low income pet owners in the Northland, we can reduce the number of litters born and the number of animals brought into shelters and rescue groups throughout the area. Our target populations are low income residents who receive some type of government assistance such as: food stamps, Medicaid, SS, disability, etc., or people who are not receiving assistance and are working, but only earn less than $30,000 a year. We are not a full service clinic and only provide the following services for dogs and cats: spay, neuter, vaccinations, micro-chip, nail trim, heart-worm test, feline FIV/Leukemia test, De-worming, tapeworm and capstar (24 hour flea treatment). Additionally, we also service clients (who do not have to meet income guidelines) in reducing the free roaming cat population in their neighborhood through the Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) Program. Plus we offer services to area rescue groups at a reduced cost. Rescue group animals are altered and vetted prior to being adopted out thus preventing unplanned litters which would most likely end up in the already over capacity city shelters. Some businesses and people in the community regularly donate food and pet related items. This has afforded us the opportunity to have an onsite Food Pantry to assist our customers and rescue groups, as well as a Pet Boutique of gently used and new items for NAWS customers.</p>
